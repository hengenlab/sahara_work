I realized not everybody in our group knows how to run long jobs without our cluster, for example in rig221If you want to run a long python job for example


python script.py0.
Login to rig221

1. 
Just create a file (jobscript.sh)
with content
python script.py

To make sure
cat jobscript.sh
python script.py

2.
Change permission to executable
chmod 700 jobscript.sh

3.
nohup ./jobscript.sh > jobscript.log 2>&1 &
Now even if your ssh login crash, you close laptop (ssh connection closed)
job will be running in background in rig221


to monitor job run
top command or just check jobscript.log file
