%% PVCALC - compute p-value for the pdf fit
% Calculates the p-value by Monte Carlo. The method uses a raw pdf with a 
% model that assumes a power law distribution with exponent tau for the 
% section of the data bounded by support [xmin,xmax]. The function 
% generates many sample distributions using a model that is composed of a 
% power-law within [xmin,xmax]. p is the proportion of sample distributions 
% with KS statistics larger than the KS statistic between the original pdf 
% and the model distribution. For computational efficiency, the function 
% continually updates the likelihood of successful results using the 
% binomial distribution and halts for statistically unlikely results.
%
% Syntax: [p, ks, sigmaTau] = pvcalc(x, tau, varargin)
%
% Inputs:
%   x (vector double) - empirical data, assumed to be power-law distributed
%   tau (scalar double) - the exponent of the power-law distribution
%
% Variable Inputs:
%   (..., 'xmin', xmin) - sets lower truncation of distribution (scalar
%     double) [default: min(x)]
%   (..., 'xmax', xmax) - sets upper truncation of distribution (scalar
%     double) [default: max(x)]
%   (..., 'samples', nSamples) - the number of sample distributions to draw.
%     Sets the resolution of the p-value (scalar double) (default: 500)
%   (..., 'threshold', pCrit) - for computational efficiency, a critical
%     p-value can be used to halt the computation if the likelihood of a
%     successful trial (given by the binomial distribution) drops below a
%     pre-determined likelihood value. If pCrit is set to 1, the 
%     computation will execute in full (scalar double) (default: 1)
%   (..., 'likelihood', likelihood) - likelihood threshold for binomial
%     process (scalar double) (default: 10^(-3))
%
% Outputs:
%   p (scalar double) - proportion of sample distributions with KS
%     statistics larger than the KS statistic between the empirical pdf and
%     the model distribution. p is bounded by 0 and 1. A p-value of 1 
%     indicates that the KS statistic between the empirical pdf and the 
%     model was smaller than the KS statistic between the sample 
%     distributions and the model. Conversely, a p-value of 0 indicates 
%     that KS(simulated) > KS(empirical) for every sample.
%   ks (scalar double) - Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic between the 
%     empirical pdf and the model
%   sigmaTau (scalar double) - error of the tau original fit estimated 
%     using the samples drawn from the model fit. If p is small, this error
%     is not valid. 
%
% Example:
%   x = pldist(10^4);
%     % generate non-truncated, power-law distributed data
%   tau = plmle(x);
%   [p, ks, sigma] = pvcalc(x, tau)
%     % compute (truncated) p-value, KS statistic, and error on power law 
%     % exponent
%   p = pvcalc(x, tau, 'threshold', 1)
%     % compute full p-value
%   p = pvcalc(x, tau, 'likelihood', 10^-5)
%     % compute p-value with threshold for binomial process set to 10^-5
