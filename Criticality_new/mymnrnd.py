%% MYMNRND - custom-made multinomial random number generator
% Custom version of the MatLab program mnrnd. 
%
% Syntax: y = mymnrnd(n,p)
%
% Inputs:
%   n (scalar double) - number of trials for each multinomial outcome
%     (a.k.a. sample size)
%   p (vector double) - 1-by-K vector of multinomial probabilities, where K
%     is the number of multinomial bins or categories. p must sum to 1. K
%     must be greater than 1.
%
% Output:
%   y (vector double) - 1-by-K vector containing the counts for each of the
%     K multinomial bins
%
% Example:
%   y = mymnrnd(10^3, [.2, .3, .5])
%
% Other m-files required: none
% Subfunctions: poissrnd, normrnd, binornd
% MAT-files required: none
%
